# Ride-Data-Analysis
Ride IT platform created a detailed ride data analysis dashboard for 2011–2020, covering bookings, cancellations, offers, and driver performance.

🚀 Ride Data Analysis Dashboard

• Understand booking and ride trends across years, months, and days
• Evaluate driver performance by gold level and ratings
• Track cancellations by both drivers and passengers
• Monitor month-over-month trends in bookings, rides, and offers
• Assess the impact of marketing campaigns and service types (Taxi & PHV) on business outcomes

The dashboard is built using Power BI Desktop, leveraging advanced visuals, dynamic filters, KPIs, and robust DAX measures.
